> Work in progress.

Official [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) interactive tutorial.

Can either be self-led or be used as part of a hands-on event (e.g., tutorial
or workshop).  If you are holding an event, also check out the [A-Frame
Presentation Kit](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-presentation-kit).

## Local Development

The Workshop is built using [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/).
All of the pages of the Workshop are maintained in a single markdown file,
`content.md`. Use `------` to separate sections and `---` to separate
subsections.

1. [Download the repository (.ZIP)](http://github.com/aframevr/aframe-workshop-kit/zipball/master)
2. Start the local server (`npm install && npm run start`)
